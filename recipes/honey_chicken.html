    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken breasts bathed in a tangy, citrus honey marinade, then baked. This is a great marinade for chicken breasts. For a more low-fat recipe, try reducing the amount of oil. As far as I can tell, it's just used to 'glue' the marinade to the chicken.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup orange juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To Marinate: In a nonporous glass dish or bowl, combine the orange juice, lemon juice, oil, honey, salt, pepper, curry powder and paprika. Mix well, then add chicken breasts and toss to coat. Cover dish and refrigerate to marinate overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from marinade, discarding of any remaining marinade, and place in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 20 to 25 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.</li>
    </ul>
