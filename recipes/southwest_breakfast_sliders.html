    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>¼ cup minced cooked ham</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced onion </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced bell pepper</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>6 slider buns, toasted</li>
        <li>3 slices Cheddar cheese (such as Sargento®)</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons salsa</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a medium skillet over low heat.</li>
        <li>Combine eggs, ham, onion, bell pepper, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Pour into the hot skillet and scramble egg mixture until cooked, 1 to 2 minutes. Don't overcook or you'll have rubbery eggs.</li>
